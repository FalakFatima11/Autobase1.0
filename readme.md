# Autobase 1.0 - Autonomous Driving Platform

Autobase 1.0 is an autonomous driving platform developed from the ground up by students at AUV-ZHCET Club. This project aims to create a robust and versatile system for autonomous vehicles, providing a foundation for learning, experimentation, and development in the field of autonomous driving. :teacher:

## Structure
The Project is divided into various components each being developed sequentially. Some of the modules are listed below:

1. **Carla Simulation**
   * This module contains the scripts for setting up a virtual enviroment to test the stack. All of our further modules will be tested on this test bench. To learn more about setting up carla head on to Carla.md in the Docs folder. 

2. **Controller** 

3. **Global Planner**

4. **Local Planner**

5. **Perception**

## Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Autobase 1.0 is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy integration and customization of various components.
  
- **Sensor Integration:** As of now the platform supports integration with the LiDAR sensor. In future a variety of sensors, including cameras, lidar, radar, and more, to provide comprehensive perception capabilities will be added.

- **Control Algorithms:** Autobase 1.0 incorporates state-of-the-art control algorithms for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and path planning.

- **Learning Resources:** The platform comes with extensive learning resources, documentation, and tutorials to facilitate the understanding and development of autonomous driving systems.
