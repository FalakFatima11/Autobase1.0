# Autobase 1.0 - Autonomous Driving Platform

Autobase 1.0 is an autonomous driving platform developed from the ground up by students at AUV-ZHCET Club. This project aims to create a robust and versatile system for autonomous vehicles, providing a foundation for learning, experimentation, and development in the field of autonomous driving.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Autobase 1.0 is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy integration and customization of various components.
  
- **Sensor Integration:** As of now the platform supports integration with the LiDAR sensor. In future a variety of sensors, including cameras, lidar, radar, and more, to provide comprehensive perception capabilities will be added.

- **Control Algorithms:** Autobase 1.0 incorporates state-of-the-art control algorithms for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and path planning.

- **Learning Resources:** The platform comes with extensive learning resources, documentation, and tutorials to facilitate the understanding and development of autonomous driving systems.
